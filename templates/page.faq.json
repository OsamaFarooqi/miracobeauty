            "answer": "<p>MIRACO Beauty is formulated with all skin types in mind, even sensitive. However, we understand that some people may have allergies to even <a href=\"\/blogs\/articles\/best-ingredients-for-all-skin-types\" title=\"What Are the Best Ingredients for All Skin Types\">natural ingredients<\/a> therefore, we suggest checking our ingredient labels. As a rule of thumb, we recommend doing a patch test with any products before using them.<\/p><p>If pregnant or breastfeeding, we recommend consulting with your doctor. Although we don't formulate with retinol, we use active ingredients (AHAs and BHAs in the <a href=\"\/products\/anti-aging-s-cell-super-cream\" title=\"S-Cell Super Cream With 9 Peptides, Ceramides and Diamond Powder\">S-Cell Super Cream<\/a>). We include the full list of ingredients on every product page for full transparency. <\/p><p>If further assistance is needed, do not hesitate to email any questions to inquiry@miracobeauty.com<\/p>"

Derived from the Antarctic’s extremely cold ocean, it prevents cutaneous dryness and is efficacious against cold weather while protecting the skin.
